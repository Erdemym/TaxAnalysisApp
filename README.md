# TaxAnalysis Program

I developed the TaxAnalysis program to streamline the classification of taxpayers based on audit criteria, reducing the margin of error while speeding up the analysis process. Originally written in Python, I later rewrote the program in C# to further enhance its capabilities.

## Features

- Efficiently analyze data from three distinct Excel files.
- Increased data checks to minimize potential errors.
- Implemented a validation system to prevent user errors during data entry.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- Excel
- Data Analysis
